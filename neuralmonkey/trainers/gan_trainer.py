     Bandit objective (Eq. 2) described in 'Bandit Structured Prediction for
     Neural Sequence-to-Sequence Learning'
     (http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P17-1138)
     It's recommended to set subtract_baseline = True.
    2) sample_size > 1, normalize = True, ce_smoothing = 0.0
     Minimum Risk Training as described in 'Minimum Risk Training for Neural
     Machine Translation' (http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P16-1159) (Eq. 12).
    3) sample_size > 1, normalize = False, ce_smoothing = 0.0
     The Google 'Reinforce' objective as proposed in 'Googleâ€™s NMT System:
     Bridging the Gap between Human and Machine Translation'
     (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.08144.pdf) (Eq. 8).
    4) sample_size > 1, normalize = False, ce_smoothing > 0.0
     Google's 'Mixed' objective in the above paper (Eq. 9),
     where ce_smoothing implements alpha.

    Note that 'alpha' controls the sharpness of the normalized distribution,
    while 'temperature' controls the sharpness during sampling.
